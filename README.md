HeyRice is a facebook application developed during Rice Hackathon that shows events on a map of Rice campus. 
User gets to see events on the map.
Different types of events are color-coded based on spacial/time proximity and type (free food, beer, etc.).
Future work can extend this applicatino to other maps/locations.
